"Brain Games" is a set of five console games, built on the principle of popular mobile brain training applications. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed. Wrong answers end the game and suggest replaying it.

Games: 

* Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be evaluated.
* Progression. Find missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
* Find an even number.
* Find the greatest common factor.
* Find a prime number.
